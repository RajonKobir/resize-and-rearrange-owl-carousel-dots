# Resize and Rearrange Owl Carousel Dots
You can rearrange the owl dots by putting class before and after the active class continuously. Also can resize them and positioning them by CSS (positon:absolute;) as your wish.
You can take the owl carousel "items" and put class just after and before the "active" class. And customize them as well.
Thank You!
